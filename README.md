# gallery-shuffler

p5 sketch to view a moving grid of images in a directory. Pretty self explanitory.

This needs to run in the directory where your images live, and ideally you'll want to to serve the directory statically locally (any simple http server will do!) Otherwise, you will find yourself stuck in the muck of CORS.
